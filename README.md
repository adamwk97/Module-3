1. I believe the following errors with the code presented are firstly that it does not properly open the paragraph. This should be done by adding
an ">" after the initial "<p" to close it. Another problem I think I see is that "script type="javascript">" should replace the opening 
"<script>" in order to tell the reader that it is Javascript. 

2. For the separate png, jpg and gif images, I used the same image and downloaded it as all three file types. I do not notice any observable difference in the quality of the image nor were there any complications in downloading/uploading the file in one format or another. I did however notice that the .gif file took slightly longer to download, however othat than that all three files seem to fill the same purpose.
